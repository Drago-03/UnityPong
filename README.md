# UnityPong

This is basic 3d Unity ping pong based game. This project is incomplete as i made this in just one week with prior experience. In this game, there is a ball, two rackets and a beautiful arena. This project was built by me in a hurry as my plan was to show it in my major project workshop in my C.S.E diploma.

In this, so far I've added 2 scenes. Scene 1- Main Menu. (which contains start game(working), Settings page(not working-Incomplete), and Exit(working) Scene 2- COntains the main game.

This project uses UnityEditor 2021.3.29f1.
